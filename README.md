# InvestmentTestTask

### The task:

Write a module (i.e. several functions with same prefix) that takes: Agreement date, Calculation
date, X, R and N as input data and calculates Sum of all future interest payments.

Code requirements/restrictions:

  • You can use any programming language you familiar with (but APL/C# is a plus)
  
  • The code should follow maintainability principals.
  
  • There should be well defined single-entry point (interface) in the code that takes input
    argument and returns the result.
